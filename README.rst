LevelPy
=======

A pythonic interface to the `LevelDB`_ database.

About
-----

LevelPy is a project that does not directly access a LevelDB instance, but
intends to be a thin wrapper around other implementations, providing a simple
and pythonic interface to the lower level database.

**LevelPy alone does *NOT* provide access to a database, nor does it declare
one as a dependency. It is up to YOU to choose and install such a package.**

In addition to the pythonic interface, LevelPy database objects adhere to the
`LevelDB API`_, which uses uppercase methods such as 'Get'. Any objects which
provide this interface interacts directly to the underlying database object, so
these expect python bytes objects for keys and values.


Usage
-----

Constructor
~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a 'connection' to a leveldb database, use the ``LevelPy.LevelDB``
class, providing a path and, optionally, the *full* classname (package + class)
of the backend to use. The default class is ``leveldb.LevelDB``, using the
`py-leveldb <https://github.com/rjpower/py-leveldb>`_ interface.

You can also give a class as the second parameter, which is interpreted to be
the *type* of the connection to create. This is called with the path and
expanded keyword arguments. Similarly, any callable can be used as the second
parameter, and the constructor will forward the path and any keyword arguments
to it (the database instance **MUST** be returned by the function).

Alternatively, you can create a separate leveldb connection and pass this to the
levelpy.LevelDB constructor. If the first parameter is not a string, it is
assumed to be an (already connected) backend, and the 'backend class' parameter
is ignored.

examples:

.. code:: python

  from levelpy import LevelDB

  db = LevelDB('/path/to/db')  # use the default leveldb.LevelDB backend
  --------------------
  db = LevelDB('/path/to/db', 'plyvel.DB', error_if_exists=True)  # use the Plyvel backend w/ keyword
  --------------------
  db = LevelDB('/path/to/db', 'my.custom.leveldb.DATABASE')  # use your own backend
  --------------------
  cls = leveldb.LevelDB
  db = LevelDB('/path/to/db', cls)  # use a specific class to create an instance
  --------------------
  db = LevelDB(cnx)  # use an already created leveldb connection (backend string is ignored)

levelpy.LevelDB will import the package and store an instance of this class,
forwarding any keyword arguments to the constructor.

Of course, there is no absolute standard interface so there is no guarantee
that all implementations will work. Currently this class assumes that all the
standard functionality of the original implementation of leveldb is exposed as
capitalized method names: ``db.Get(...)`` ``db.Put(...)`` etc. LevelPy's
LevelDB class aliases these methods to expose a 1-1 interface of the wrapper
and backend (if they exist). If the backend you wish to use has a different
convention, simply set the aliased methods after creating the connection:
``db.Get = db._db.retrieve_value`` (access the backend database is provided by
the ``_db`` attribute).


Access
~~~~~~

As LevelDB is really just a big key-value store, LevelPy implements a
dict-interface to the database (using the [] operators).

.. code:: python

  item = db['itemkey'] # store value with key 'itemkey' as item
  db['something'] = 'else' # store value 'else' with key 'something'

  a_to_b = db['a':'b']  # get all items between 'a' and 'b' (inclusive)

  has_5 = '5' in db  # tests if '5' is a key in the database

As mentioned in Constructor, such access is also provided by the ``Get`` &
``Put`` members.

Iteration
~~~~~~~~~

Keeping the database dictlike, LevelPy exposes the methods items(), keys(),
values(), which provides generators to iterate over the expected items.

.. code:: python

  keystr = ' '.join(key for key in db.keys())

  for k, v in db.items():
      print(k, '->', v)


Classes
~~~~~~~

Levelpy introduces some specialized classes to solve common problems while
working with the database.


LevelDB
^^^^^^^

LevelDB is the main class responsible for loading and querying the database.
A "real" leveldb library/class must be used to actually handle the file io.
To make your own, simply write a class that implements the LevelDB API.


Views
^^^^^

Views are read-only structures that are built with a prefix which is
automatically added to any request. Views may contain other views, creating
smaller slices of the full database.

Views provide the levelpy reading-interface: get and iteration.


Sublevels
^^^^^^^^^

Sublevels are like views but provide full read-write support to the database.
The user may create sublevels within a sublevel for more specific requests.
Views may be created from sublevels, but a sublevel cannot be created from a
view, as they are read only.

Sublevels provide the levelpy read and write interfaces: get, put, delete,
iteration, batch writes.


Serializer
^^^^^^^^^^

LevelDB requires keys and values in the database to be python byte objects, so
all other types (such as strings) must be encoded to bytes upon request or
storage. LevelPy provides a serialization module with functions that implement
various encoding/decoding schemes. Most LevelPy database objects have a
value_encoding parameter in the constructor; if this is a string, it searches
the Serializer.transform_dict dictionary for the encode/decode pair with the
string. Alternatively, you can supply a tuple of 2 callables which encode
incoming objects to bytes, and decode bytes into objects. This, mixed with
sublevels, provide an excelent method to store countless different types in
a single database, with automatic type retrieval.

By default the Serializer provides string encoding ("utf8"), trivial binary
encoding ("bin"), arbitrary json object encoding for dicts ("json"), and the
more efficient msgpack serialization library ("msgpack", must be installed
seperately)

Custom serialization keys may be added to the transform_dict, for easy access
to custom serializations. It is recommended to call Serializer.update() after
modifying the transform_dict, which updates the Serializer's encode and decode
dictionaries.
